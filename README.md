# Signals

## 1. 20 kHz Sine wave modulated with FM
```
fm = 20 kHz
fc = 110 kHz
df = 75 kHz
B = 2 * (fm + df) = 190 kHz
f_max = fc + df = 185 kHz
f_min = fc - df = 35 kHz
```

## 2. 20 kHz Square wave modulated with FSK
```
fm = 20 kHz
fc = 275 kHz
df = 75 kHz
f1 = fc + df = 
f2 = fc - df = 
B = 2 * df + 2 * fm = 190 kHz
f_max = fc + df = 200 kHz
f_min = fc - df = 350 kHz
```

## 3. 20 kHz Sawtooth wave modulated with AM
```
fm = 10 kHz
fc = 385 kHz
B = 2 * fm = 20 kHz
f_max = fc + fm = 395 kHz
f_min = fc - fm = 375 kHz
```

## 4. 20 kHz Square wave OOK
```
fm = 20 kHz
fc = 440 kHz
B = 6 * fm = 120 kHz
f_max = fc + fm = 450 kHz
f_min = fc - fm = 430 kHz
